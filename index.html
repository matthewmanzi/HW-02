                            <p>Matt Manzi is currently a practicing pharmacist-in-charge at an independent pharmacy in Milltown, New Jersey. The aptly-named "Milltown Pharmacy" has been a familiar fixture in the quaint historical town, serving its community since 1985.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Having served in big box retail settings for a few years after he graduated, Matt became disenfranchised with corporate pharmacy's policy of treating his patients like pieces of a grand statistics game and left it all behind to find his place in a setting where he could better serve his people with more freedom and with the time and respect they deserve.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Not long after leaving his corporate lifestyle behind, he was approached by two savvy entrepreneurs who were looking for a young managerial upstart to take over the pharmacy they had acquired two years prior. In recently deciding to expand their business to two pharmacies, they had need of a pharmacy manager to take charge of their home store. They hired Matt for the position, and the rest is history.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Now, as Matt begins his transition toward full command of Milltown Pharmacy, he is looking for ways to streamline the pharmacy workload in the clunky layout of the aged edifice. To that end, he has enrolled in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp part-time to learn about full-stack web development to develop his foundational knowledge of coding, and to spring forth from this new education into the world of creating automated processes that could replace some of the workload handed to the pharmacy technicians, thereby freeing them up to handle more of the back-end profitability tasks that are crucial to keeping the pharmacy in business.</p>

                            <h2 class="meetIHPADHead">DISCOVER THE MYTH<div class="dividerLine"></div></h2>
                            <p>Idle Hands Pharmacy Automation Deployment (IHPAD) is the brainchild of Matt’s motivation to increase productivity and profitability at Milltown Pharmacy, without sacrificing any of the precious trust and love that it shares with the community.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Central to the philosophy of IHPAD is identifying “Dead Time” in a pharmacy’s workload throughout the day. Dead Time is found in the minutia of a staff member’s usual daily tasks and work. Dead Time is the seconds, microseconds, or less that a worker wastes by purely moving themselves in-between or during tasks.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>To take an extreme example, when a pharmacy technician is in the front store putting up shelf labels, but are then diverted to walking all the way over to the drive-thru to help a customer, only to then walk halfway back to the will-call bin to retrieve prescriptions, and finally walk back to the drive-thru to complete the sale—that entire transaction is laden with Dead Time. This person cannot reasonably be expected to physically run from one point of the pharmacy to another for any reason, and even if they did, that is still Dead Time. It is time spend completing a task that accomplishes little in itself, other than to move the person from step A to step B of that same task.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>So how will IHPAD tackle the Dead Time problem? Ah, those ideas are what will make it a success! We cannot tell you about specifics, but to answer your question in general terms, the goal of IHPAD will be to develop and implement software and small-footprint hardware solutions within the pharmacy to minimize the necessity of Dead Time for predefined daily tasks. These will not be large-scale operations, such as designing a robot to automatically retrieve prescriptions from the will-call bin; they will instead be small, dynamic, scalable modules, augmentations, and upgrades that will connect to processes already in place. For that reason, the service model that IHPAD will adopt is that of personal customization. IHPAD will survey client pharmacies, come up with a short list of handy modules that they think are a good fit for the workload, present them to the clientele, and if agreed upon will then tweak them to their specific needs, install them, and provide ongoing assistance and maintenance.</p>
