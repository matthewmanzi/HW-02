                <p class="stdPgph">One of my core beliefs is that people are more than just capital in a business environment. It is true that we all experience wear and tear both physically and mentally on the job, and of that a manager must always be mindful and proactive. However, the sum of how they are treated with regard to their emotional health and well-being are just as important as anything else. For that reason, a successful manager must be absolutely sure to be constantly tuned into the happiness of their employees. Happy employees are the best employees. Unhappy employees are a source of wasted time and will tend to spread their ill feelings toward their co-workers, leading to a negative domino effect in the workplace. Whether I am in charge or a member of a larger team, I am always sure to keep this front-of-mind for the sake of workplace efficiency and well-being.</p>
