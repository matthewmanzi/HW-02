Welcome.


This website marks the official inauguration of an idea in my mind taking its first step toward reality. This website contains information pertaining to Idle Hands Pharmacy Automation Deployments, a company that I hope to establish one day. The functions of IHPAD will be to function not on large-scale, mass-production pharmaceutical equipment; rather, it will focus on implementing small automations, robotics, etc. that can be used to physically do all of the repetitive tasks (and there are many) that pharmacists and pharmacy technicians do. 


The very act of grabbing a bottle of pills, or pouring it onto a counting tray, walking from the service window to the will-call area to retrieve a prescription—these are all what I call “Dead Time.” This is time spent merely for the sake of completing a physical task and achieves nothing else. I believe that by introducing augmentations to these little parts here and there, a pharmacy can achieve a much more productive workflow for its team, with less wear-and-tear on the staff and more focus on other tasks that need to be accomplished behind the scenes to keep a pharmacy in business.


This website details the relevant background about myself, my relationship to IHPAD, and the functions of IHPAD. Hopefully one day it will contain much more real data.
